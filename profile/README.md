## Working Practices
Project management follows an agile framework using GitHub issues and projects.

### Issue Types
Issues related to project work should include one of the following labels and always link to a parent, unless it is an Epic.
1. :crown:Epic
2. :trophy:Feature
3. :book:Story
4. :clipboard:Task / :bug:Bug / :test_tube:Test

### Milestones / Sprints
Only :book:Story, :clipboard:Task, :bug:Bug and :test_tube:Test issues should be assigned to Milestones and Sprints to better track burndown and completion percentage. Sprints are currently set to 2 weeks.

Epics and Features are generally expected to remain open, unless they are deprioritized or completed with no expectation of future work.
